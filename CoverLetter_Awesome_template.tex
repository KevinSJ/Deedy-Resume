I read with interest your posting for Information Technology Leadership Program  on the your company website.  I believe I possess the necessary skills and experience you are seeking and would make a valuable addition to your company.

My relevant qualifications include my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Most recently I worked as Student Help Developer for Traffic Operations and Safety Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison. In this role, I was responsible for developing and refining functionality for Wisconsin Lane Closure system as well as helping students resolve software problems on the lab computers. Here I refined my java enterprise software development and problem solving skills related to computer software and harware. With these skills and qualifications, I believe I would be a great addition to your organization.
 
I have attached my resume for your review and I look forward to speaking with you further regarding your available position.
